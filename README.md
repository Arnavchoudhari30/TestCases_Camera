# TestCases_Camera
A comprehensive set of test cases for verifying camera functionality, including UI, functionality, performance, security, and compatibility testing. Covers scenarios such as camera launch, photo/video capture, autofocus, low-light performance, permissions handling, and third-party app integration.

1. UI Test Cases
Verify that the camera app icon is visible and correctly labeled.

Check if the camera interface elements (shutter button, flash, zoom, settings) are correctly placed.

Ensure that the camera preview is displayed without any distortion or lag.

Verify that the camera orientation adjusts correctly when the device is rotated.

Check if the camera UI remains responsive after multiple interactions.

2. Functional Test Cases
Verify that the camera launches properly when opened.

Test if the camera captures images correctly and saves them to the gallery.

Check if the video recording starts/stops properly and saves correctly.

Validate autofocus and manual focus functionality.

Test zoom in/out functionality and ensure image clarity.

Verify that front and rear cameras switch correctly without lag.

Check if the camera works properly when accessed via third-party apps.

3. Performance Test Cases
Measure the time taken to open the camera app.

Check for any lag or crashes when capturing photos/videos continuously.

Verify image quality in different lighting conditions (low light, bright sunlight, etc.).

Check video recording for frame drops, stuttering, or overheating issues.

4. Security & Permission Test Cases
Verify that the camera does not function without required permissions.

Check if the app requests camera access only when needed.

Ensure that unauthorized apps cannot access the camera in the background.

5. Compatibility Test Cases
Test camera functionality on different screen sizes and resolutions.

Verify behavior on different OS versions (Android/iOS).

Check camera performance with different camera hardware models.
